        <ul>
            <li>To authenticate your identity and secure your account.</li>
            <li>To provide location-based services, such as showing nearby exchange shops on a map.</li>
            <li>To allow shop owners to manage their listings and advertise rates.</li>
            <li>To improve the functionality and user experience of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. Your personal information is not embedded within these tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our App integrates with third-party services, specifically:</p>
        <ul>

We do not verify these rates and are not responsible for any discrepancies, losses, or damages arising from reliance on this information. Users are advised to verify rates directly with the shop before transacting.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, ForexFinder and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>
